    My first project.  My dad found this as a pile of pieces when I was 15.  By the time I was 17 and a senior in high school we had it back together in good running order. 
    It was my only transportation and I used it as such, after all it was just a 35 year old used car.  I learned a lot and had a lot of fun with my dad restoring it.  Washington

    Somehow I got into antique tractors when we lived in Northern Kentucky. It was a popular hobby there.  The family attended the huge tractor show every year in Portland, IN.  I finally sprang for this '38.  The last of the unstyled John Deeres.  It was rusty, the engine was locked up...it needed everything.  A satisfying project to bring it back to life.  I ended up rationalizing it by also getting a two row corn planter, 2 row integral cultivators, a two bottom plow, a disc and growing some sweet corn to roadside.

    The family had relocated from Kentucky to Fremont and I needed a second car.  In my mind it would be either a 912 or a BMW Bavaria (more on the Bavaria later).  I found this 912 in the Sacramento area.  Nice paint and interior. I discovered later that it was pretty rusty and that the engine smoked with a trailing throttle.  I sold it a year or so after i bought it.

He gave the pile of parts to me.  Zack, Mark Kaufmann and I rented a trailer. drove to Seattle and picked up the pieces.  For a few years after that I always had plenty to look for at the local swap meets.  It resembled a car and ran and drove when I sold it.

It went to the Grand National Roadster Show, was one of the top 100 hot rods of Rod and Custom magazine in 2001, won 2 GoodGuys Trophies.  I should have kept this one.

The dad had died and the son needed to get his projects out of an expensive Atherton home so he could sell the property.  There were actually 2 cars.  One well along in the restoration (the one shown here) and a complete but rusty car he was using as a model.  The work on the nearly restored car was exceptional and included all new or restored parts to finish the car including a beautiful interior.  I bought both with a low ball offer including many of the parts that were in his other residence in Nevada City.  He just wanted everything gone so he could sell the houses.  I made a killing flipping these.

Larry and I removed the wheels with rotten and flat tires and had some good used tires installed, then trailered it to the airport. I cleaned it up the best I could.  It was complete and together. The JFIT (junk found in trunk) consisted of an empty bottle of Oldsmobile Rocket Fuel (an alcohol/water mix that was automatically fed to the engine when under boost), and a couple of spare turbos.

    Bought in Squmish for a future project.  I took it apart and inspected it, cleaned it, painted it and reassembled it.  It would be a great combo for a T-Bucket type hot rod.

    Bought off of eBay in Southern California.  A very rare rust free, one owner car.  I put an LB9 305 in it with a kit from Renegade.  Neat little car.  I had tons of challenges both with the conversion and with the "good used" 305 that ended up getting rebuilt a few times. Made a killing [on BaT](https://bringatrailer.com/listing/1976-porsche-914-38/) when I sold it, however.

    Bought off of Craigslist.  Dave and I went to Eastern Washington to pick it up. Rust free late model which is the easiest to convert to a V8.  I already had the engine (Rover) that I had bought in Seattle when I was consulting at Clear Wire.  Bob Peterson sold me a World Class T5 out of a V8 Camaro.  I backdated it by converting from the big ugly bumpers to the delicate chrome ones.  I found some new Heritage front wings.  I used early low back bucket seats. I repainted it Pale Primrose Yellow.  It was a fun project.  I

    Jon's friend Blake had this car for a few years and had the body work done by a moonlighting pro.  It was completely torn apart when I bought it. He was not a car guy and figured out he'd have way too much money in the car by the time he finished.  I bought it for the next to nothing price he offered it to me for.  It ran and drove well, but needed a lot of cosmetic help.  Paul painted it.  When finished, I drove it to Monterey, CA, for the Legends of the Autobahn show in conjunction with Pebble Beach.

    I had wanted one of these when I was 18 and had been looking for the right one for several years.  This one came up on eBay.  I was the high bidder at about $3k.  The seller told me he only wanted out of it what he had into it and sold it to me for $1300.  Dave and I went to Idaho to pick it up.  It need only a few mechanical fixes.  I cleaned it up.  Paul painted it.  And I had the chrome redone.  I ride it around the neighborhood just to listen to its unique sound.

    I bought this Tolly in Blaine in partnership with Mike Macevoy.  It wasn't running well.  We got it running good enough to ferry it from Blaine down to Hilton in Bellingame.  Sometime during our short ownership, the engine (454 Chevy) blew up.  We found a good core and had Scott Reed rebuild it.  Also installed new water cooled exhaust manifolds.  We cleaned and painted the bottom and generally detailed the boat.  We had a lot of fun doing the project and broke even when we sold it.

    I found this one on eBay in SoCal.  John Larsen and I flew to Oakland, BART to San Jose, Zack picked us up there and we spent the night at his house.  Then Amtrak to San Luis and Em's.  Borrowed her car and drove to Ventura to pick up the Volvo.  Then a 3 day drive back to Bellingham.  It made it!  I tuned it, replaced some front end parts and cleaned it up.  [Sold it on BaT](https://bringatrailer.com/listing/1968-volvo-122s-16/)
