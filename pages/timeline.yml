    My first project.  My dad found this as a pile of pieces when I was 15.  By the time I was 17 and a senior in high school we had it back together in good running order. 
    It was my only transportation and I used it as such, after all it was just a 35 year old used car.  I learned a lot and had a lot of fun with my dad restoring it.  Washington
    Blue, black fenders and Tacoma Cream wheels.

    Somehow I got into antique tractors when we lived in Northern Kentucky. It was a popular hobby there.  The family attended the huge tractor show every year in Portland, IN.  I finally sprang for this '38.  The last of the unstyled John Deeres.  It was rusty, the engine was locked up...it needed everything.  A satisfying project to bring it back to life.  I ended up rationalizing it by also getting a two row corn planter, 2 row integral cultivators, a two bottom plow, a disc and growing some sweet corn to roadside.

    The family had relocated from Kentucky to Fremont and I needed a second car.  In my mind it would be either a 912 or a BMW Bavaria (more on the Bavaria later).  I found this 912 in the Sacramento area.  Nice paint and interior. I discovered later that it was pretty rusty and that the engine smoked with a trailing throttle.  I sold it a year or so after i bought it.

    There are just a hadful of the cars I've owned that I wish I could have found someway to keep, but the project was (is?) the hobby to me and they always had to be sold to fund the next project.  This was a 60,000 mile all original car.  Even smelled new.  Sand Beige over Ivory.  5 speed.  Last of the short wheel base, headlights under glass 911/912 Porsches.

    My buddy Dave Burton had found this roadster body near Goldendale in Eastern Washington.  He collected a frame, engine and various other parts but lost interest in it.  He gave the pile of parts to me.  Zack, Mark Kaufmann and I rented a trailer. drove to Seattle and picked up the pieces.  For a few years after that I always had plenty to look for at the local swap meets.  It resembled a car and ran and drove when I sold it.

    The lowest original mile vintage car that I have ever owned.  It was like a one year old used car.  Original tires even (replaced after on came apart on the freeway).  It trophied at a regional Studebaker Club show in Fresno and won its class at the Chico Concours de Elegance.  A plain 4 door sedan, but a pretty special car.

    I've lusted after the 53-54 Studebaker coupes and hardtops since highschool.  Tom and I found this one at the Turlock Swap meet in the late 1990's.  I built it exactly as I had envisioned it for the last 30 years.  60's style semi custom.  365 HP 327, 4 speed.  It took about 3 years to finish. I drove it 30,000 miles in the next 10 years.  It went to the Grand National Roadster Show, was one of the top 100 hot rods of Rod and Custom magazine in 2001, won 2 GoodGuys Trophies.  I should have kept this one.

    I bought this from Bob Peterson.  6 cylinder stick.  I was bored and needed a short project.  I got it running and driving well, addressed some cosmetic issues, bolted on a Volvo luggage rack. Sold it at a GoodGuys show the within months of the purchase.  This is the one that took a "no brake" tour of the driveway in Scotts Valley and almost ended up at the bottom of the canyon.

    Bob Kabchef found this GT and the next one at the same seller.  We partnered on them.  I fronted the money and Bob retrieved them, got them running and driving and detailed them.  We sold them on eBay.  This one was a 4 speed.

    The airport biz was slow and i started looking for projects that I could do just a little work to and then flip for a profit.  This Packard was an abandonded father/son project.  It was taken apart and that's as far as the duo got.  They essentially gave it to me.  I got it running and driving and sold it on eBay.

    I got a call one evening from the son of a fairly well known Studebaker guy.  The dad had died and the son needed to get his projects out of an expensive Atherton home so he could sell the property.  There were actually 2 cars.  One well along in the restoration (the one shown here) and a complete but rusty car he was using as a model.  The work on the nearly restored car was exceptional and included all new or restored parts to finish the car including a beautiful interior.  I bought both with a low ball offer including many of the parts that were in his other residence in Nevada City.  He just wanted everything gone so he could sell the houses.  I made a killing flipping these.

    I found this on CraigsList in the east bay.  Another one the seller just wanted gone.  I came with a bunch of extra parts.  I just love how "over the top" thes 58 big Studes were...especially the wagons.  I got it running and driving.  Bob Kapchef just HAD to have this one.  His all time favorite Stude.  I sold it to him for what I paid for it. This was a rust free, complete car.  I should have kept it.

    A rare and pretty car, but this one was very rusty.  Turbocharged aluminum V8.  Larry and I removed the wheels with rotten and flat tires and had some good used tires installed, then trailered it to the airport. I cleaned it up the best I could.  It was complete and together. The JFIT (junk found in trunk) consisted of an empty bottle of Oldsmobile Rocket Fuel (an alcohol/water mix that was automatically fed to the engine when under boost), and a couple of spare turbos. I sold the JFIT for more than I paid for the car.  The buyer of the car was planning to restore it.  I hope he did.
