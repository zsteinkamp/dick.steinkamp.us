    My first project.  My dad found this as a pile of pieces when I was 15.  By the time I was 17 and a senior in high school we had it back together in good running order. 
    It was my only transportation and I used it as such, after all it was just a 35 year old used car.  I learned a lot and had a lot of fun with my dad restoring it.  Washington
    Blue, black fenders and Tacoma Cream wheels.

    Somehow I got into antique tractors when we lived in Northern Kentucky. It was a popular hobby there.  The family attended the huge tractor show every year in Portland, IN.  I finally sprang for this '38.  The last of the unstyled John Deeres.  It was rusty, the engine was locked up...it needed everything.  A satisfying project to bring it back to life.  I ended up rationalizing it by also getting a two row corn planter, 2 row integral cultivators, a two bottom plow, a disc and growing some sweet corn to roadside.

    The family had relocated from Kentucky to Fremont and I needed a second car.  In my mind it would be either a 912 or a BMW Bavaria (more on the Bavaria later).  I found this 912 in the Sacramento area.  Nice paint and interior. I discovered later that it was pretty rusty and that the engine smoked with a trailing throttle.  I sold it a year or so after i bought it.

    There are just a hadful of the cars I've owned that I wish I could have found someway to keep, but the project was (is?) the hobby to me and they always had to be sold to fund the next project.  This was a 60,000 mile all original car.  Even smelled new.  Sand Beige over Ivory.  5 speed.  Last of the short wheel base, headlights under glass 911/912 Porsches.

    My buddy Dave Burton had found this roadster body near Goldendale in Eastern Washington.  He collected a frame, engine and various other parts but lost interest in it.  He gave the pile of parts to me.  Zack, Mark Kaufmann and I rented a trailer. drove to Seattle and picked up the pieces.  For a few years after that I always had plenty to look for at the local swap meets.  It resembled a car and ran and drove when I sold it.

    The lowest original mile vintage car that I have ever owned.  It was like a one year old used car.  Original tires even (replaced after on came apart on the freeway).  It trophied at a regional Studebaker Club show in Fresno and won its class at the Chico Concours de Elegance.  A plain 4 door sedan, but a pretty special car.

    I've lusted after the 53-54 Studebaker coupes and hardtops since highschool.  Tom and I found this one at the Turlock Swap meet in the late 1990's.  I built it exactly as I had envisioned it for the last 30 years.  60's style semi custom.  365 HP 327, 4 speed.  It took about 3 years to finish. I drome it 30,000 miles in the next 10 years.  It went to the Grand National Roadster Show, was one of the top 100 hot rods of Rod and Custom magazine in 2001, won 2 GoodGuys Trophies.  I should have kept this one.
